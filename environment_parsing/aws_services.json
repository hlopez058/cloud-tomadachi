Customers can enable Elastic Load Balancing within a single or multiple Availability Zones for more consistent application performance. Elastic Load Balancing can also be used in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (“VPC”) to distribute traffic between application tiers in a virtual network that you define.

                Workflow service for coordinating applications
                Amazon Simple Workflow (Amazon SWF) is a task coordination and state management service for cloud applications. With Amazon SWF, you can stop writing complex glue-code and state machinery and invest more in the business logic that makes your applications unique.
                Using Amazon SWF, you structure the various processing steps in an application that runs across one or more machines as a set of “tasks.” Amazon SWF manages dependencies between the tasks, schedules the tasks for execution, and runs any logic that needs to be executed in parallel. The service also stores the tasks, reliably dispatches them to application components, tracks their progress, and keeps their latest state.

                AWS Step Functions
                Build distributed applications using visual workflows
                AWS Step Functions provides serverless orchestration for modern applications. Orchestration centrally manages a workflow by breaking it into multiple steps, adding flow logic, and tracking the inputs and outputs between the steps. As your applications execute, Step Functions maintains application state, tracking exactly which workflow step your application is in, and stores an event log of data that is passed between application components. That means that if networks fail or components hang, your application can pick up right where it left off.

                Serverless event bus that connects application data from your own apps, SaaS, and AWS services
                Amazon EventBridge is a serverless event bus that makes it easy to connect applications together using data from your own applications, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications, and AWS services. EventBridge delivers a stream of real-time data from a variety of event sources and routes that data to targets like AWS Lambda. You can set up routing rules to determine where to send your data to build application architectures that react in real time to all of your data sources. EventBridge makes it easy to build event-driven applications because it takes care of event ingestion and delivery, security, authorization, and error handling for you.

                Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fast, reliable, scalable, fully managed message queuing service. SQS makes it simple and cost-effective to decouple the components of a cloud application. You can use SQS to transmit any volume of data, at any level of throughput, without losing messages or requiring other services to be always available.
                With SQS, you can offload the administrative burden of operating and scaling a highly available messaging cluster, while paying a low price for only what you use.

Amazon SNS makes it simple and cost-effective to push to mobile devices such as iPhone, iPad, Android, Kindle Fire, and internet connected smart devices, as well as pushing to other distributed services.
                Besides pushing cloud notifications directly to mobile devices, Amazon SNS can also deliver notifications by SMS text message or email, to Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) queues, or to any HTTP endpoint.
                To prevent messages from being lost, all messages published to Amazon SNS are stored redundantly across multiple availability zones.
